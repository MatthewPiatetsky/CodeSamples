This is a project where I created a concordance for a given block of text.
In the file Concordance.java I created a GUI for the concordance where the user can input text and see the output.
In the file Worldlist.java I used binary trees to store and sort the words in the input text.
Run the main of Concordance.java to test the concordance.
