This is the final lab for my systems class. 
We had the backbone infrastructure for the 6502 microprocessor, designed by my professor Jonathan Appavvoo. 
The loop.c file is essentially the cpu going through and executing the instructions for the program, located in the instruction.c file.
Our task was to implement this file, which contains instructions for dealing with registers, memory, data buses etc...
You should be able to test this with the help of the documentation provided by my professor.
